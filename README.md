 My 1st huge project but not already done. 

This project uses React (
    1. custom hooks; 
    2. useContext; 
    3. useState; 
    4. useEffect; 
    5. useRef), 
    Firebase (Firestore/auth), 
    Tailwind CSS, 
    LoadTest, 
    Lighthouse, 
    Vercel, 
    React Testing Library,
    Cypress E2E Testing and
    react-spinner-loader.

    Thanks also Karl Hadwen for teaching me for creating this project - 
    on huge tutorial for freeCodeCamp. 

    Really appreciated for that.
